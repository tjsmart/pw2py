Need to implement ability to add/remove/sub atoms
note add and remove should make call to sub

implement function to copy atomic positions from one file to qeinp



Supercell implementation (some things may also be useful for scellEmbed)

0. store intial pos_units
1. convert positions to crystal
2. make sure all pos are in within the cell i.e. 0 <= r_i < 1 for i in x,y,z
3. apply transformation matrix to cell par, and atomic pos
4. determine symmetric positions which are in the box
