Several todos written in-line of the code

High priority
    --> deprecate qegeo, just use atomgeo and qeinp, qegeo has proven to not be useful


Add more unit tests (may help with debugging)
    --> test for jdftx and xyz
    --> test for scripts
    --> tests for file with labels (like the co3o4 file)

Medium priority
    --> clean/finish examples (rename to tutorials -- make videos?)
    --> update documentation elsewhere e.g. README
    --> write wavefunction to xsf file / cube file
    --> read wavefunction/eigenvalues from vasp
    --> calculate dQ, dQ xsf

Low priority
    --> download cells from materials project (using selenium and chrome driver and envrionment variable for api key)
    --> generalized supercell implementation
    --> ibrav to/from 0 method in atomgeo
