Several todos written in-line of the code

High priority
    --> from_file('local/scf') fails?
    --> from_file('local/scf.out') fails?


Add more unit tests (may help with debugging)
    --> test for jdftx and xyz
    --> test for scripts
    --> tests for file with labels (like the co3o4 file)

Medium priority
    --> qeout could use some love
    --> clean/finish examples (rename to tutorials -- make videos?)
    --> update documentation elsewhere e.g. README

    --> read wavefunction/eigenvalues from vasp
