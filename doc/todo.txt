Add more unit tests (may help with debugging)

Several todos written in-line of the code


High priority
    --> gauranteed that several things will break when an ion name is indexed (as is often the case), need to find and resolve these issues where they exist
        -- For example try running tests with a file with 'Fe1' and 'Fe2'


Medium priority
    --> test for jdftx and xyz
    --> test for scripts
    --> clean/finish examples (rename to tutorials -- make videos?)
    --> update documentation elsewhere e.g. README
    --> write wavefunction to xsf file
    --> read wavefunction/eigenvalues from vasp
    --> calculate dQ, dQ xsf


Low priority
    --> download cells from materials project (using selenium and chrome driver and envrionment variable for api key)
    --> generalized supercell implementation
    --> ibrav to/from 0 method in atomgeo
