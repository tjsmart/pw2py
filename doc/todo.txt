Unit tests (may help with debugging)

Several todos written in-line of the code


High priority
    --> gauranteed that several things will break when an ion name is indexed (as is often the case), need to find and resolve these issues where they exist
        -- For example try running tests with a file with 'Fe1' and 'Fe2'
    --> all methods of atomgeo need to be checked for todos when they are used within qeinp


Medium priority
    --> clean/finish examples
    --> update documentation elsewhere e.g. README


Low priority
    --> download cells from materials project (using selenium and chrome driver and envrionment variable for api key)
    --> generalized supercell implementation
    --> is ntyp/nat an issue in qeinp?
