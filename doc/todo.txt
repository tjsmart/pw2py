Unit tests (may help with debugging)

High priority
    --> issue in qegeo and qeinp
        need to add ntyp property so that (similiar to nat) ntyp is not accessed through the namelist but rather set and updated
    --> issue when loading geo
        for example:
            >>> cp_geo.py tests/input_files/og.xsf tests/input_files/og.in
        gives output where the pos_units are not properly transferred from the xsf file to the input file


Mediume priority
    --> clean/finish examples
    --> update documentation elsewhere e.g. README


Several todos written in-line of the code


helpful scripts:
    debug -- implement function to copy atomic positions from one file to qeinp
    done -- implement function to write atomic positons in a different format



Supercell implementation (some things may also be useful for scellEmbed)

0. store intial pos_units
1. convert positions to crystal
2. make sure all pos are in within the cell i.e. 0 <= r_i < 1 for i in x,y,z
3. apply transformation matrix to cell par, and atomic pos
4. determine symmetric positions which are in the box
