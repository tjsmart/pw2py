Several todos written in-line of the code


helpful scripts:
    implement function to copy atomic positions from one file to qeinp
    implement function to write atomic positons in a different format



Supercell implementation (some things may also be useful for scellEmbed)

0. store intial pos_units
1. convert positions to crystal
2. make sure all pos are in within the cell i.e. 0 <= r_i < 1 for i in x,y,z
3. apply transformation matrix to cell par, and atomic pos
4. determine symmetric positions which are in the box
