Several todos written in-line of the code

Add typing to methods/attributes

./scripts/reorder_atoms.py needs better implementation for checking (cases where distances alone cannot determine if two atoms are the same)


Add more unit tests (may help with debugging)
    --> test for jdftx and xyz
    --> test for scripts
    --> tests for file with labels (like the co3o4 file)
    --> tests for qesave

Medium priority
    --> qeout could use some love
    --> class for qedir (bundles classes and methods for reading qeinp, qeout, and qesave!)
    --> clean/finish examples (rename to tutorials -- make videos?)
    --> update documentation elsewhere e.g. README
    --> write wavefunction to cube file
        --> also need to fix xsf after figuring out how flatten with order='F'
    --> read wavefunction/eigenvalues from vasp

Low priority
    --> download cells from materials project (using selenium and chrome driver and envrionment variable for api key)
    --> generalized supercell implementation
    --> ibrav to/from 0 method in atomgeo
